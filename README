Documentation and build/install instructions
can be found in the manual (documentation/manual.pdf).

Quick instructions:

 - edit config/CONFIG and set target application
   (MAKEFOR=MATLAB  or MAKEFOR=SCILAB)
   and (optionally) the installation directory.
   You can also enable (experimental) support
   for Ctrl-C handling there. With this feature
   enabled, you can interrupt lcaGet/lcaPut by
   hitting Ctrl-C on the keyboard.
   
 - edit config/RELEASE to point to your
    o EPICS base
    o MATLAB
    o SCILAB
   installation directories and (WIN32 only)
    o set MATLIB_SUBDIR to point to your compiler
      dependent libmx/libmex versions.
 - set EPICS_HOST_ARCH (EPICS 3.13: HOST_ARCH) environment
   variable.
 - run GNU make from this directory.
