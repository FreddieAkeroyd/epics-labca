This directory contains a modified version of the 'ezca' library
(version 20020802):

 - thread-safeness added (mutex allows only one thread into ezca at
   a time)
 - enable preemptive callbacks with EPICS 3.14
 - bugfix: GETNELEM should set *wp->inp
 - fixed some signedness warnings
 - added 'ezcaAbort()' to abort polling loops from a signal handler.
