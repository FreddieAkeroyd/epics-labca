Changes since labca_2_0_alpha (T.S):
    2005/6/7 (TS):
	- flush output buffers (lcaPutNoWait())
Changes since labca_1_5 (T.S):
    2004/3/24 (TS):
	- EZCA modifications:
       o try to recycle work nodes marked as 'trashme'.
       o assume ca_clear_channel() does real cleanup (i.e. assume
		 it cancels scheduled callbacks) and hence recycle channel
         structures from push_channel(). Also, have push_channel()
         remove deleted channels from the hash table.
       o call clean_and_push_channel() if search attempts timeout:
         probably, the PV name is invalid and we want to prevent 3.14 
         background tasks to continue searching.
       o provide 'ezcaClearChannel()' and 'ezcaPurge()' to let the user
		 explititely remove unneeded channels.
    - provide 'lcaClear()'.
	- Provided 'lcaPutNoWait()' for setting values without waiting for
      record processing to complete on the server.
Changes since labca_1_5pre_beta (T.S):
	- set shared library version numbers in anticipation of future
      releases.
Changes since labca_1_4_beta (T.S):
	2004/3/8 (TS):
	- Have the matlab version call 'errMsgTxt()' on error to 
      trigger the standard way of error flagging. I finally
      found the reason for the linux crashes (matlab ships with outdated
      system libraries) ;-)
    - Implemented a workaround in ezErr() -- Scilab's mexPrintf()
      [i.e. sciprint] crashed when munging long strings (multi-line
      errors). We now break those messages up in smaller chunks...
    - multi_ezca_put() now returns a value to indicate error status
      (rval == number of successfully written PVs, -1 on error).
Changes since labca_1_3_beta:
	2004/2/20: T.S added matlab implementation of lcaGetStatus()
	2004/2/20: T.S added this ChangeLog
